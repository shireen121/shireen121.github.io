**The Problem**  

My first project at Metis was a group project with 3 of my classmates. We were tasked with helping a fictitious client, WomenTechWomenYes, who were looking to increase attendance, fundraising and awareness of their cause of getting more women in technology through their annual gala. Specifically, they wanted us to help them look at MTA subway data and assist in placing their street teams at subway entrances to get sign-ups. And they wanted us to share our analysis in FOUR days.  

**Brainstorming**

Wasting no time, we started brainstorming and came up with the following plan:  
1. Select an appropriate time period and start exploring the MTA subway data
2. Find a complementary dataset to beef up our analysis (tech company locations in the city)
3. Work on visualizations
